<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Growing up in a small town, I have always had this dream of starting my own tech company. 
  Ever since I was a kid, I was fascinated by computers. I remember spending countless afternoons tinkering with old hardware and coding simple programs just for fun. 
  I  would read everything I could find about successful entrepreneurs, soaking up their stories and advice like a sponge.</p>

<p>Inspired, I started developing a unique app designed to help students organize their studies better. 
  The process was not easy; I encountered technical issues and moments of self-doubt that made me question whether I was cut out for this. 
  But I pushed through, fueled by the support of a few close friends who believed in me.</p>

<p>One of the most exciting moments came when I decided to present my prototype at a local youth innovation fair.
  I was nervous, but the positive feedback I received was a huge boost to my confidence.
  I realized then that building a business was a journey, full of ups and downs, but it was a journey I was ready to embrace. 
  Now, more than ever, I am excited to pursue my dream and see where it takes me.</p>
